## CakePHP datasources plugin - 2.0 branch

This plugin branch will be used to port the different datasources to CakePHP 2.0 As you can see right now it is empty, but it will be filled with the time coming. So stay tuned!

## Contributing to datasources

If you have a CakePHP 2.0 datasource, or an idea for a datasource that could benefit the CakePHP community, please for the project on github. Once you have forked the project you can commit your datasource class (and any test cases). Once you have pushed your changes back to github you can send a pull request, and your changes will be reviewed and merged in or feedback will be given.
